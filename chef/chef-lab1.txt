Chef: An Overview
What is Chef?
Chef is a powerful automation platform that transforms infrastructure 
into code. It allows you to automate how you configure, deploy, 
and manage your servers, applications, and services. Chef ensures 
that your infrastructure is consistently configured and managed,
reducing manual intervention and increasing reliability.

Why Chef?
>>Consistency: Ensures all environments (development, staging, production) are consistent.
>>Automation: Automates the configuration, deployment, and management of infrastructure.
>>Scalability: Easily scales to manage thousands of servers.
>>Compliance: Helps maintain compliance by defining policies as code.
>>Flexibility: Supports multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

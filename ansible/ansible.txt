What is ansible:-Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool, 
used for configuration management, application deployment, 
orchestration, and provisioning. It automates tasks such as 
installing software, configuring systems, and managing servers.

Why Use Ansible?
>>Simple to Learn and Use: Ansible uses a simple, human-readable language (YAML) to define automation jobs, making it easy for new users to understand and write automation scripts.

>>Agentless: Unlike other automation tools, Ansible does not require any agents to be installed on remote systems. It uses SSH for communication.

>>Powerful and Flexible: Ansible can manage a wide range of tasks, from simple to complex automation processes, across many different environments.

>>Efficient and Scalable: Ansible can efficiently manage and automate large-scale environments without requiring extensive resources.


Advantages of Ansible
>>Agentless: No need to install any software on the managed nodes.

>>Easy to Learn: Uses YAML for configuration, which is easy to read and write.

>>Idempotent: Ensures that multiple executions lead to the same state, avoiding unintended changes.

>>Modular: Extensive collection of modules to perform various tasks.

>>Flexible: Can be used for various automation tasks including configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.

>>Powerful: Integrates well with other tools and supports complex workflows.

Disadvantages of Ansible
>>Performance: Can be slower compared to agent-based systems for large-scale environments due to the overhead of SSH connections.

>>Limited Windows Support: Primarily designed for Unix-like systems, although Windows support has improved.

>>Complexity with Scale: Managing very large inventories can become complex.

Key Terms
>>Playbook: YAML file that contains a series of tasks to be executed on managed nodes.

>>Inventory: File that lists the hosts to be managed, along with their variables.

>>Task: An action to be performed on a managed node.

>>Role: A way to organize tasks and related files to be reusable.

>>Module: A unit of code that performs a specific task (e.g., yum, apt, service).
